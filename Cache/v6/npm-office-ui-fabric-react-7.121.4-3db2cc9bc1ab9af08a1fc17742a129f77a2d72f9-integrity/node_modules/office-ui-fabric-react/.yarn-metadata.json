    "readme": "> The **Office UI Fabric React** project has evolved into **Fluent UI React**! We have a lot in store for Fluent UI - [Read our announcement here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/) and see more details about what this means for package consumers below.\n\n# [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)\n\n**The React-based front-end framework for building experiences for Microsoft 365.**\n\nFluent UI React ([formerly Office UI Fabric React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/)) is a collection of robust React-based components designed to make it simple for you to create consistent web experiences using the Fluent Design Language.\n\nFor information about available controls, see the [Fluent UI website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui).\n\nTo get started using or contributing to Fluent UI React, see the [full readme](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/blob/master/README.md).\n\n## Moving to `@fluentui/react`\n\nGoing forward, the `office-ui-fabric-package` will be renamed to `@fluentui/react`. The `@fluentui/react` package exists today as a mirror of `office-ui-fabric-react`'s public API surface. (Updates will still be published under both names for at least the duration of version 7.)\n\nIf you'd like to start using `@fluentui/react` now, you can do so by changing your dependency and imports.\n\nImports in either of these formats can be directly renamed:\n\n```ts\n// Old\nimport { TextField } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';\nimport { TextField } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/TextField';\n\n// New\nimport { TextField } from '@fluentui/react';\nimport { TextField } from '@fluentui/react/lib/TextField';\n```\n\nHowever, deeper imports from internal files **will not** work with `@fluentui/react`. (These types of imports are also unsupported today, as internal file paths are considered private APIs and therefore subject to change without notice.)\n\n```ts\n// Not supported currently; won't work with @fluentui/react\nimport { TextField } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/components/TextField/index';\n\n// Use instead\nimport { TextField } from '@fluentui/react';\nimport { TextField } from '@fluentui/react/lib/TextField';\n```\n\nIf you're currently depending on an API which you think should be public but is not exported from the top level of the package, please [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues) to discuss.\n",
