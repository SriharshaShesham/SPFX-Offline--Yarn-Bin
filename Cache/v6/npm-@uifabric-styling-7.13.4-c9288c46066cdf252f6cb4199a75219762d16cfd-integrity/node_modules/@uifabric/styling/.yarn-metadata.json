    "readme": "# @uifabric/styling\n\n**Styling helpers for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**\n([formerly Office UI Fabric React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/))\n\n## Using the styling package\n\nIntegrating components into your project depends heavily on your setup. The recommended setup is to use a bundler such as webpack which can resolve NPM package imports in your code and can bundle the specific things you import.\n\nIf you're using `@fluentui/react`, the `@uifabric/styling` package contents are re-exported under `@fluentui/react/lib/Styling` (for `office-ui-fabric-react`, use `office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Styling`). It's recommended to access styling this way rather than via a direct dependency.\n\nIn a project which doesn't use `@fluentui/react` (or `office-ui-fabric-react`), you can still install the styling package as a dependency:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save @uifabric/styling\n```\n\nThis gives you access to styling-related constants, utilities, and Fabric Core style classes through JavaScript.\n\n## Overriding the theme colors\n\nThe default palette of colors matches the default Fabric core styling conventions. However, it is possible to override the color slots to match your product requirements:\n\n```tsx\nimport {\n  loadTheme({\n    palette: {\n      themePrimary: 'red',\n      themeSecondary: 'blue'\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nIf you override theme settings, you need to do this before accessing theme colors. Otherwise you won't get a notification that the theme changed.\n",
